# osbuild-operator
Operator for Openshift designed to simplitfy usage of [Image Builder](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_a_customized_rhel_system_image/index).

## Description
Even though a comprehensive [OSBuild Ansible collection](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.osbuild) exists, there is still a gap in running OSBuild on top of Openshift. This operator provides an opinionated way to simplify image generatation using an Openshift cluster.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need an Openshift cluster to run against with enough available resources to start a 4Gi / 2 core virtual machine. Please note if your cluster is already running inside virtual machines, you will need nested virtualization.

[Openshift Virtualization](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/virt/about-virt.html) and [Openshift Pipelines](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cicd/pipelines/op-release-notes.html) are required in your cluster.

### Running on the cluster using prebuilt image

If you just want to run the operator using the prebuilt image at `quay.io/cgament/osbuild-operator:latest`, you just need to run:

```sh
make deploy
```

This will create a `osbuild-operator-controller-manager` deployment in the `osbuild-operator-system` namespace and install the required CRDs.

If you want to use a custom image:

```
IMG=<registry>/<image>:<tag> make deploy
```

### Uninstallation

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Test it Out

There are two CRDs at the moment:

1. ImageBuilder

```yaml
apiVersion: osbuild.rh-ecosystem-edge.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageBuilder
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  sshKey: "<ssh-key>"    # optional
  subscriptionSecret:    # optional; default=osbuild-subscription-secret
  servicePort:           # optional; default=8080
```

`ImageBuilder` is a namespaced resource, with the following fields:
  * `spec.sshKey`: optional, the key to be used for accessing the virtual machine with the user `cloud-user`
  * `spec.subscriptionSecret`: optional, default is `osbuild-subscription-secret`, the name of the secret that holds the Red Hat subscription username and password; must be in the same namespace as `ImageBuilder` resource
  * `spec.servicePort`: optional, defaults to `8080`, the port on which the osbuild service will be exposed

Creating this resource will run and configure a virtual machine that runs OSBuild and exposes the API via a Openshift service.

Deleting this resource will cleanup and delete all the resources associated with it.

2. ImageBuilderImage

```yaml
apiVersion: osbuild.rh-ecosystem-edge.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageBuilderImage
metadata:
  name: image
spec:
  imageBuilder: <imagebuilder>          # optional
  userName: "<user-name>"               # optional; default=root
  sshKey: "<ssh-key>"                   # optional
  isoTarget: "<target>"                 # optional; default=edge-installer
  installationDevice: "<device>"        # optional
  fdoManufacturingServerUrl: "<url>"    # optional
  persistentVolumeName: <pvc-name>      # optional; default=<name>-data
  blueprintTemplate: "<go-template>"    # optional; specify a Go Template for the commit blueprint
  blueprintIsoTemplate: "<go-template>" # optional; specify a Go Temaplte for the installer iso blueprint
```

`ImageBuilderImage` is a namespaced resource, with the following fields:
  * `spec.imageBuilder`: optional, name the of `ImageBuilder` service to be used. If missing, the operator will try to use an existing resource in the current namespace
  * `spec.userName`: optional, defaults to `root`, user to embed in the image
  * `spec.sshKey`: optional, the ssh key used for accesing the image for the specified user
  * `spec.persistentVolumeName`: optional, defaults to `<ImageBuilderImage.name>-data`. the volume used for storing generated images and temporary data. The PVC needs to exist, the operator will not create a new one.
  * `spec.isoTarget`: optional, defaults to `edge-installer`. Can be `edge-installer` or `edge-simplified-installer` for FDO
  * `spec.installationDevice`: optional, the installation device; required `edge-simplified-installer`
  * `spec.fdoManufacturingServerUrl`: optional, the FDO Manufacturing server url; required for `edge-simplified-installer` target
  * `spec.blueprintTemplate`: optional, a Go Template can be specified for the commit blueprint using the Spec variables. The default is usually good enough.
  * `spec.blueprintIsoTemplate`: optional, a Go Template can be specified for the installation blueprint using the Spec variables. The default is usually good enough.

Creating this resource will generate and create several Openshift objects, including a `Pipeline` and a paused `PipelineRun`. Starting this pipeline will generate an ostree commit and the associated installation iso. The artifacts can be accessed as follows:

```sh
url=$(oc get routes.route.openshift.io --selector osbuild-operator-image -o json | jq -r '.items[].spec.host')
curl -LO "${url}/installation.iso"
curl -L "${url}/repo/"
```

## Development

Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<registry>/<image>:<tag>
```

To install the CRDs from the cluster:
```sh
make install
```

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```
